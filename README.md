# gorsync

A cross-platform file synchronization command-line tool similar to rsync, designed for local network use with TCP-based transfer.

> **Important Security Note**: This tool is strongly recommended for use within local networks only, preferably through network grouping (e.g., VPN or LAN). Do not use it directly over the public internet as it does not include encryption or authentication mechanisms.

## Project Origin

This project was generated by [TraeAI](https://www.trae.ai)

## Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **TCP-based network transfer**: For reliable file synchronization within local networks
- **File integrity verification**: Uses MD5 hash calculation to ensure file integrity
- **Resume transfer functionality**: Ability to resume interrupted transfers
- **Progress printing**: Detailed transfer progress information during file synchronization
- **Safe file operations**: Uses temporary files with MD5 verification before overwriting target files
- **Sequential file transfer**: Processes files one by one for reliable synchronization
- **Simplified sync logic**: Directly compares files by MD5 hash for efficient synchronization
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes local files that don't exist on the remote server

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gorsync.git
cd gorsync
go build -o gorsync ./cmd/gorsync
```

### Run directly

```bash
go run ./cmd/gorsync [arguments]
```

## Usage

### Start a server (listening mode)

```bash
# Start server with default port 8730
gorsync -listen

# Start server with custom port
gorsync -listen -port 9000
```

### Sync files (client mode)

```bash
# Sync from source to remote destination
gorsync -path /path/to/source -peer 192.168.1.100 -remote /path/to/destination

# Sync with custom port
gorsync -path /path/to/source -peer 192.168.1.100:9000 -remote /path/to/destination
```

## Command-line Arguments

| Argument  | Description                                 | Default |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-path`   | Local directory path for synchronization    | N/A     |
| `-peer`   | Remote peer address                         | N/A     |
| `-listen` | Start in listening mode (server)            | false   |
| `-port`   | Port number for server or client connection | 8730    |

## Examples

### Basic synchronization

```bash
# Server side (listening mode)
gorsync -listen

# Client side (sync operation)
gorsync -path ./source -peer 192.168.1.100 -remote /destination
```

### Using custom port

```bash
# Server side (custom port)
gorsync -listen -port 9000

# Client side (connect to custom port)
gorsync -path ./source -peer 192.168.1.100:9000 -remote /destination
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

- **pkg/transfer/transfer.go**: File transfer functionality with MD5 verification
- **pkg/net/server.go**: TCP server for file transfer
- **pkg/net/client.go**: TCP client for file transfer
- **pkg/sync/sync.go**: Synchronization logic
- **pkg/diff/diff.go**: File difference comparison
- **pkg/utils/hash.go**: MD5 hash calculation utilities

### Key Features

1. **File Transfer**: Uses TCP for reliable file transfer with MD5 verification to ensure file integrity
2. **Sequential Transfer**: Processes files one by one for reliable synchronization
3. **Safe Operations**: Uses temporary files and safe rename operations to ensure atomic file updates
4. **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed progress information during file transfer
5. **Simplified Sync Logic**: Directly compares files by MD5 hash for efficient synchronization
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes local files that don't exist on the remote server

### Network Protocol

- Uses TCP for all file transfers
- Default port: 8730
- Supports binary file transfer with chunked encoding
- Includes MD5 hash verification for file integrity

### Testing

1. Start a server in listening mode
2. Run a client to sync files to the server
3. Verify that files are correctly synchronized
